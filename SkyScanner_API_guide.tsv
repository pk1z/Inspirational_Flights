This provides a more straightforward option for partners who do not require a full implementation of a travel search product within their applications. If the query isn’t specific enough to link to a specific ‘day view’ page, it will link to a more general browse page, where the user will be asked to refine the search criteria (by date, origin and/or destination)."
"BOOKING REDIRECTS"	"To the supplier"	"https://skyscanner.github.io/slate/#to-the-supplier"	"When using flights live prices or car hire live prices urls (or deeplinks) are provided in the response to redirect users to the third-party supplier’s website with the details of the itinerary that was selected."
